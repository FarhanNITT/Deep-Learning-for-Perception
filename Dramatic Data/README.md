# Object Segmentation for Drone Navigation Assistance Using Synthetic Data

In this project, we designed and implemented a deep neural network capable of **segmenting drone racing windows** to enhance **visual navigation**. It was done as a part of the "Deep Learning for Perception" course.

This project composed of three parts:
1) Synthetic Dataset Generation
2) Semantic Segmentation
3) Instance Segmentation
