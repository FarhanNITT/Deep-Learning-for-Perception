# Color Classification using a Single Gaussian
In this project, we explore object segmentation in images using a probabilistic approach based on color. Rather than deterministically labeling a pixel as a specific color (e.g., red or green), we assign probabilities to different colors. This method is particularly useful in real-world scenarios where sensor noise and varying lighting conditions can affect color perception.

We treat color classification as a machine learning problem, where each pixel is given a probability of belonging to a particular color class (e.g., determining the likelihood that a pixel belongs to a green cap based on its RGB values). Given a pixelâ€™s RGB values, we estimate the probability that it belongs to a specific class.

For each class, we estimate the spread of RGB values by analyzing the dataset to model the probability distribution. To compute the likelihood of a pixel belonging to a particular class given its RGB value, we apply Bayes' rule.

# Approach 
1) Estimate the mean and covariance matrix for each class after extract the RGB values from each image corresponding to that particular class.
2) Compute the probability density function for every pixel in the provided images. Then make a binary mask using a threshold (tunable).
3) Apply the binary mask on the provided images to segment objects of each class separately.
